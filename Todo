*** Final Notes *** 
Actually enjoyed this assignment despite failing to complete all milestones and
pending grade, wish I could spend an extra week on it. To revise when more freed up:

1. ** Time management: 
   - May have taken the wrong path choosing NOT to use Bootstrap and external icons.
     Even though I like styling and css it is quite time consuming, and this time
     could have been spent on writing better code.
   - Made the mistake not to use the same template for posts in feed AND profile,
     would've save a lot of time oto.

2. Need code clean up. Need clear separation of "components"/"rendering"/"states" ?
   This will probably prevent having imports all over the place.
   Look into examples of building SPA with Vanilla JS and routing.
   (Will make one appreciate React even more)

3. Reuse functions as much as possible?

4. Push notifications: Check for new state every ___ interval, compare with current
   state and check the difference.

5. implement better UI etc., but ensure the basics are clean and working well first
   before go on to the fluff.

6. Make warnings look nicer instead of using alerts.

7. Consider marker's suggestions and comments when revising.

8. Do this again in React?
